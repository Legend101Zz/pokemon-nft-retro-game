The retro Pokemon game with NFT added is a project that involves purchasing NFTs of different Pokemon characters and using them to play the game. The game is designed to resemble the classic Pokemon games that were popular in the 1990s, but with the added twist of NFT ownership.

The NFTs represent unique, one-of-a-kind versions of each Pokemon character, which can be collected and traded among players. Players can purchase NFTs of different Pokemon characters through a marketplace or by participating in game events.

Once a player has acquired an NFT of a Pokemon character, they can use it to play the game. The game is currently single-player, meaning that players can battle against computer-controlled opponents and explore the game world on their own. However, we plan to add multiplayer functionality in the future, allowing players to battle against each other using their NFT Pokemon.

The NFTs are also designed to have a real-world value, meaning that players can potentially earn money by collecting and trading them. This adds an extra layer of excitement to the game, as players can compete to acquire rare and valuable NFTs.

Overall, the retro Pokemon game with NFT added is an innovative project that combines the nostalgia of classic Pokemon games with the exciting world of NFT ownership and trading. With the addition of multiplayer functionality in the future, it has the potential to become a popular and engaging MMO game that attracts players from around the world.
